## 🎯 About Me

I'm **Andrew Makau**, a **Full-Stack Developer & Data Enthusiast** pursuing a **BSc. in Applied Computer Science** at **Daystar University** (since September 2022), based in **Nairobi, Kenya**.  
I focus on building solutions that connect people, unlock opportunities, and leverage **data & AI** to solve real-world problems in **finance and services**.

### 💡 Background

I started coding in **April 2022**, building small inventory and budgeting apps that showed how code can directly improve everyday life.  
Since then, my goal has been clear: **be the bridge between problems and solutions through technology**—especially in African markets.

**Core Mission:** Use **software + data + AI** to  
- connect service providers with the people who need them  
- democratize access to financial tools  
- turn everyday experiences into meaningful economic opportunities

## 🚀 What I’m Doing Now
📚 Learning: Python for Data Analysis & ML/AI frameworks
🎯 Focus: Data Science - Backend Development - AI/ML
🔥 Goal: Build production-grade AI solutions for finance
💼 Status: Open to Remote Roles - Collaborations - Mentorship

If you’re working on **data, finance, or AI products**, I’d love to connect and collaborate.
