## 🎯 About Me

I'm **Andrew Makau**, a passionate **Full-Stack Developer & Data Enthusiast** currently pursuing my **BSc. in Applied Computer Science** at **Daystar University** (since September 2022). Based in **Nairobi, Kenya** 🇰🇪, I'm on a mission to solve real-world problems through technology.

### 💡 My Story
My coding journey began in **April 2022** when I discovered the power of code to solve everyday problems. What started with simple inventory and budgeting apps evolved into a passion for creating meaningful solutions.
